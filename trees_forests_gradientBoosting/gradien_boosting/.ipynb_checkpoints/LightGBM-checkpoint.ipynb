    "<div class = 'alert alert-box alert-success'>\n",
    "    \n",
    "> <b>Gradient-based One-Side Sampling, или сокращенно GOSS</b>, - это модификация метода градиентного бустинга, которая фокусирует внимание на тех обучающих примерах, которые приводят к большему градиенту, что, в свою очередь, ускоряет обучение и снижает вычислительную сложность метода. То бишь каждое следующее дерево обучается в первую очередь на тех экзмеплярах, на которых сильно ошиблось деревья предыдущие.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "С помощью GOSS мы исключаем значительную часть примеров с малым градиентом, а оставшиеся используем только для оценки информационного выигрыша. Поскольку экземпляры данных с большими градиентами играют более важную роль в вычислении информационного выигрыша, GOSS может получить достаточно точную оценку информационного выигрыша при гораздо меньшем объеме данных.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class = 'alert alert-box alert-success'>\n",
    "    \n",
    "> <b>Exclusive Feature Bundling, или сокращенно EFB </b>, - это подход к объединению разреженных (в основном нулевых) взаимоисключающих признаков, таких как входы категориальных переменных, которые были закодированы в один момент времени. Как таковой, он представляет собой тип автоматического отбора признаков.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Идея метода</i>:\n",
    "EFB объединяет разреженные и взаимно исключающие признаки в один \"связанный\" признак, чтобы снизить количество признаков, обрабатываемых моделью. Это полезно в случае, если данные состоят в основном из нулевых значений (например, при one-hot кодировании категориальных переменных). Так как эти признаки являются взаимно исключающимися (в одном объекте только один из таких признаков может принимать ненулевое значение), их можно объединить в один признак, что существенно экономит ресурсы.\n",
    "\n",
    "Пример:\n",
    "Представьте категориальные данные с несколькими уникальными значениями, закодированные как one-hot. Это создаст множество бинарных признаков, которые будут в основном состоять из нулей, за исключением одного ненулевого значения для каждого примера. EFB объединяет эти признаки в один, сохраняя только ненулевые значения. В результате размерность данных уменьшается, что ускоряет обучение модели и снижает объем памяти, необходимой для хранения признаков.\n",
    "\n",
    "Применение:\n",
    "Алгоритм EFB работает, выявляя взаимно исключающие признаки и объединяя их. Он определяет, какие признаки никогда не будут одновременно ненулевыми для одного и того же примера, а затем объединяет их в новый признак, что снижает количество признаков, обрабатываемых моделью.\n",
    "\n",
    "Вместе эти два изменения могут ускорить время обучения алгоритма до 20 раз. Таким образом, LightGBM можно считать градиентным бустинговым деревом решений (GBDT) с добавлением GOSS и EFB."

    "### Особенности LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Алгоритм построения деревьев: **Leaf-wise** vs **Level-wise**\n",
    "\n",
    "- LightGBM использует leaf-wise (<u>разделение по листьям</u>) построение деревьев, в то время как классический градиентный бустинг чаще всего применяет level-wise (<u>разделение по уровням</u>). В **leaf-wise** алгоритме на каждой итерации выбирается лист с наибольшей прибавкой к функции стоимости, что позволяет уменьшить ошибку быстрее и достичь лучшего качества. Однако этот подход может привести к переобучению на малых данных.<br>\n",
    "- Классический бустинг (например, XGBoost) обычно использует **level-wise**, где дерево строится, добавляя новые уровни по всей ширине дерева одновременно. Это более сбалансированный метод, но он менее эффективен с точки зрения скорости и использования памяти.\n"

    "### 2. Скорость и масштабируемость\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM разработан для высокой производительности и может обрабатывать большие датасеты гораздо быстрее, чем традиционные реализации бустинга. Это достигается благодаря нескольким улучшениям:\n",
    "- **Histogram-based алгоритм**: LightGBM использует гистограммы для оптимизации поиска лучшего разделения в дереве, что ускоряет обучение и снижает использование памяти.\n",
    "- **Прореживание данных (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling, GOSS)**: этот метод позволяет отбирать данные с высоким градиентом для точного обучения и игнорировать менее значимые данные с малым градиентом, что также увеличивает скорость.\n"
